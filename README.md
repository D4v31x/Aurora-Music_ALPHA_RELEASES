# Aurora-Music_ALPHA_RELEASES
Aurora Music is now available on GitHub! You can find monthly updates and releases of the application there. Please note that these releases are in ALPHA version, meaning the application is still in its early stages of development and not yet complete. These releases serve as a way for me to respond to bugs, suggestions, and comments. For any inquiries, please contact us at info.aurorasoftware@protonmail.com
